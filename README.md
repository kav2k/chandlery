# Chandlery for Fallen London

Chandlery is an **unofficial** Chrome/Chromium helper extension for [Fallen London](https://fallenlondon.com/)

As long as your Fallen London tab is open, Chandlery will monitor and update the tab title with your current number of actions and Opportunity deck cards.

It will also optionally show desktop notifications when your candle or deck are full. The idea is to alert you that you start losing potential actions/opportunities because your pool is filled.

**Installation:** The original extension [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chandlery-for-fallen-lond/anhebaghddcipcnlgoehajobofkgghje). I haven't currently uploaded this fork to the Chrome Web Store yet, though I might do that in the near future.

The extension works by observing an open Fallen London page, no requests to the server - it stops updating if you close your tab (and stops updating the deck count if the deck is not visible).

This is a fork of [Chandlery](https://github.com/kav2k/chandlery) attempting to make it compatible with FL's redesign. I'm happy to take feature requests, as long as they don't violate the "no automation" rule of Fallen London, but I can't guarantee further support.
