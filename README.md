# Chandlery for Fallen London

Chandlery is an **unofficial** Chrome/Chromium helper extension for [Fallen London](http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com/)

As long as your Fallen London tab is open, Chandlery will monitor and update the tab title with your current number of actions and Opportunity deck cards.

It will also optionally show desktop notifications when your candle or deck are full. The idea is to alert you that you start losing potential actions/opportunities because your pool is filled.

**Installation:** [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chandlery-for-fallen-lond/anhebaghddcipcnlgoehajobofkgghje)

[Failbetter Games commiunity forum topic](http://community.failbettergames.com/topic19830-browser-extension-chandlery-for-fallen-london.aspx)

The extension works by observing an open Fallen London page, no requests to the server - it stops updating if you close your tab (and stops updating the deck count if the deck is not visible).

Feature requests are welcome, as long as they don't violate the "no automation" rule of Fallen London.
